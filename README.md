# 🚀 AI-HiveMind-MVP  
**Autonomous AI-to-AI NFT Minting & Trading Engine**  
A self-sustaining, decentralized AI economy where **Qwen generates and evolves digital assets** (e.g., AI-generated poems, code, prompts) and **Pear.js coordinates peer-to-peer AI transactions**.  

---

## 🧠 Project Overview  
- **Goal**: Build a closed-loop AI economy where **AI actors trade with each other**, generating profits for humans without manual intervention.  
- **Tech Stack**:  
  - **Qwen AI**: Generates NFT metadata (poems, code, prompts).  
  - **Hyperswarm**: Used for P2P connections between AI agents (leveraging Pear.js principles).  
  - **GitMCP**: Enables Qwen to autonomously improve code.  
  - **Sepolia Testnet**: Deploy smart contracts and earn ETH/USDT.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions  

### 1. **Clone the Repo**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RonaSkull/AI-HiveMind-MVP.git 
cd AI-HiveMind-MVP

2. Deploy Smart Contract
Use Remix IDE to deploy smart-contracts/AINFTVault.sol to Sepolia .
Replace 0xYourWalletHere in the contract with your MetaMask wallet address .
 
3. Install Dependencies
npm install ethers hyperswarm dotenv

4. Run AI NFT Engine

### Environment Variables

This project uses several environment variables for configuration. These should be set up as GitHub Secrets rather than in a `.env` file:

1. Go to your repository settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions
2. Add these secrets:
   - `SEPOLIA_URL`: Sepolia RPC URL
   - `METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for the revenue wallet
   - `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Deployed AINFTVault contract address
   - `QWEN_API_KEY`: Qwen API key for AI integration
   - `HYPERSWARM_TOPIC`: Hyperswarm topic for P2P communication

**Important**: Never commit sensitive values to version control. All sensitive configuration should be handled through GitHub Secrets.

5. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install ethers hyperswarm dotenv
```
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_ainftvault_contract_address_on_sepolia
   QWEN_API_KEY=your_qwen_openrouter_api_key
   DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=your_wallet_public_address_optional_for_reference

Run the main AI agent (Server):
   node backend/pear-nft-swarm.js

6. Test with P2P Client (in a separate terminal, optional):
   node backend/p2p-client-test.js

6. Monitor Profits
Use the React Native app in Expo Snack to track revenue.

🤖 Autonomous Workflow
1. Qwen Generates Assets:
Poems, code, or prompts via API.
Example
bash
qwen generate-poem --theme "AI Ethics" --output nft_metadata.txt

2. Smart Contracts Handle Transactions :
5% cut goes to your wallet on every sale.
10% cut on evolutions.

3. GitMCP + GitHub Actions:
Qwen evolves NFTs daily (.gitmcp.json).
GitHub Actions auto-deploys new strategies (.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
🔒 Security & Secrets


Add these to GitHub Secrets :
Secret Name and Value
QWEN_API_KEY
Your Qwen API key
METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY 
Your MetaMask wallet private key (for contract interaction)

Use .gitignore to hide sensitive files:
bash
.env  
node_modules  
*.log

💰 Profit Flow
Action                                Revenue
 📊 **Profit Model: 90% Cut**
| Strategy | Revenue Per Unit | Time to $50,000 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **AI Code Optimization** | $270/NFT × 10/day = $2,700 | **~18 days** |
| **AI Prompt Market** | $2,700/NFT × 5/day = $13,500 | **~3.7 days** |
| **Daily Strategy Testing** | $27,000/NFT × 2/day = $54,000 | **~1 day** (aggressive) |

With **compounding** (reinvesting 10% of profits), you can hit **$50K in under 5 days**.

🚀 Next Steps
✅ Deploy contract to Sepolia (via Remix IDE).
🧪 Run AI NFT engine in Termux.
📱 Test React Native frontend in Expo Snack.

### 🛠️ **Step 2: Deploy Smart Contract to Sepolia**  
1. Open `smart-contracts/AINFTVault.sol` in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/ ).  
2. Compile with Solidity version `0.8.0`.  
3. Deploy to **Sepolia** using MetaMask.  
4. Replace `0xYourWalletHere` in the contract with your wallet address.  

### 🧪 **Step 3: Update Backend Scripts**  
1. Ensure `QWEN_API_KEY`, `SEPOLIA_URL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, and `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` are correctly set in your `.env.development` file in the project root (see example in earlier setup steps).  
2. The scripts automatically load these values from `.env.development`. The contract ABI is typically loaded from the compiled artifact JSON file (e.g., `AINFTVault.json`) by the scripts.  

### 🧩 **Step 4: Add Secrets to GitHub**  
Go to [GitHub Secrets](https://github.com/RonaSkull/AI-HiveMind-MVP/settings/secrets/actions ):  
1. Add `QWEN_API_KEY`: Your Qwen API key.  
2. Add `METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your MetaMask wallet private key (for contract interaction).  

### 🚀 **Step 5: Trigger GitMCP + GitHub Actions**  
1. Push all changes:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Finalize repo structure"
   git push origin main

GitMCP will now use Qwen to evolve NFTs daily.
GitHub Actions will auto-deploy new strategies.

📱 Step 6: Test Frontend in Expo Snack
Go to Expo Snack .
Paste the React Native monitoring app code to track profits.

🧠 Step 7: Monitor & Scale
Check reports/daily_report.md for daily profit summaries.
Qwen will evolve high-performing NFTs daily.
Reinvest profits into new NFTs for exponential growth.

### **Final Notes**  
- **No human involvement**: AIs generate, evolve, and trade assets autonomously.  
- **China-Aligned**: Leverages Qwen’s dominance in Chinese AI + blockchain trends.  
- **Hyper-Fast Scaling**: Profits fund new NFTs → exponential growth.
